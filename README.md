1.	“The City of Caral” and “Introduction to Prehistoric Europe” contain both secondary and primary sources. The secondary source is the accounts of history (that was written far after the fact), and the primary source would be this [photograph](http://callisto.ggsrv.com/imgsrv/FastFetch/UBER1/glvm_0001_0003_0_img0237) of the site of Caral as it looks currently and the [photograph](https://dailylife2-abc-clio-com.ndcproxy.mnpals.net/assets/images/sites/DLTH/favicon.ico?v=2) of a stenciled hand.
“Homo Sapiens Migrate from Africa” again has the secondary source of the current understanding of history which was formulated much after the fact. It also contains a primary source, with this [map](http://callisto.ggsrv.com/imgsrv/FastFetch/UBER1/glvm_0001_0001_0_img0004 [4] : http://go.galegroup.com.ndcproxy.mnpals.net/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3728000341&v=2.1&u=mnanorman&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=90b684cbd17e722a559ce5c3ace244d6).
2.	The last great Ice Age ended approximately 10,000 years ago.
3.	The first homo sapiens migrated out of Africa “sometime between 80,000 and 50,000 BCE” (“Homo Sapiens Migrate from Africa”, 3).
4.	From just the [picture](http://callisto.ggsrv.com/imgsrv/FastFetch/UBER1/glvm_0001_0003_0_img0237) in “The City of Caral was Built”, I would speculate that they were a small city state with advanced technology for their time. I would back this up with the clear evidence that they managed to build their pyramids, while many peoples were still struggling to even be anything other than nomadic.
5.	I would say the secondary sources have more information behind them. It is very interesting to see the primary sources of the pictures and map, but they do not tell me much, especially if they were given without the context of the secondary sources.
6.	I suppose I would be most interested in writing a novel about “The City is Caral is Built”. It is intriguing how much further advanced their society was in comparison with others of their time. They even had art that has been discovered:
<Geoglyphs… have been unearthed since 2002, including a picture of what appears to be half of a human face, as well as circular and straight lines that stretch across the arid land.
This would make an interesting jumping board for a plotline.
